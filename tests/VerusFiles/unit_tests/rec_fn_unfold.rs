// UNIT TEST — authored for verus-boole; NOT adopted from the Verus repo.
// FEATURE_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md row: B5 "`decreases` - function (int-valued termination)".
// Demonstrates: a recursive spec function measured by an int carries a defining
// axiom in the Boole output, so a caller can evaluate it at a concrete argument.
//
// Strata writes definitional axioms only for functions that recurse structurally
// on a datatype (`@[cases]`); a function measured by an int is encoded as an
// uninterpreted function. The translator supplies the defining axiom for those,
// which is what makes the assertion below provable. Turning the aid off with
// `--synth-disable recFnUnfold` leaves `walk` uninterpreted and the assertion
// comes back solver-unknown, so this test distinguishes the two encodings.
