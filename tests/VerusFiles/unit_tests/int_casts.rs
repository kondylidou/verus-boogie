// UNIT TEST — authored for verus-boole; NOT adopted from the Verus repo.
// FEATURE_SUPPORT_MATRIX.md row: A2 "bv<->int / width casts (`as`)" (#1217, all green).
// Demonstrates: native `as_bv<w>` width-widening casts and `as_int` (bv->int)
// casts preserve the source `as` semantics end-to-end.
//
// NOTE: truncating casts (e.g. `300u32 as u8`) are omitted — Verus requires a
// `#[verifier::truncate]` acknowledgement and still does not fix the spec-level
// value, so they don't give a clean positive obligation here.
