  Boole.Context — translation-owned name/index context.

  BooleDDM stores variables as numeric free-variable and bound-variable
  indices.  VLIR stores source names.  This module owns that name-to-index
  mapping for the translator so it is not coupled to Strata's CST formatting
  context.

  /-- Polymorphic 2-ary tuple type (Verus represents all tuples as nested
      binary tuples; `Unit` is the 0-ary case). Emits a datatype
      `Tuple (T0, T1) { Tuple_ctor_2(Tuple_2_0 : T0, Tuple_2_1 : T1) }`,
      giving the verifier native constructor/accessor reasoning rather
      than uninterpreted stubs. -/

  /-- Abstract declaration for `Seq_lib_zip_with<A, B>(s: Sequence A, t:
      Sequence B): Sequence (Tuple A B)`. Emitted as a support decl
      (rather than in the Seq prelude text) because its return type
      references `Tuple`, which itself is only available after the
      `.tuple` support decl is emitted. -/

      compile-time length is available at the call site. Fixed `[x; N]`
      arrays lower to concrete `Sequence.build` chains instead. -/

  /-- Polymorphic abstract `Set (T)` type, plus the higher-order /
      Set-typed Seq builtins below.  These are emitted as support decls
      (not in the Seq prelude text) because they are *polymorphic and
      higher-order*: when present-but-unused, Strata's SMT encoder cannot
      monomorphize their free type vars (`Unimplemented encoding for type
      var`).  As support decls they are emitted only when a call site
      actually references them — where the type vars monomorphize — so an
      unused builtin never reaches the encoder.  (`Seq::map` is normally
      replaced by `emitSeqMapDecls` synthesis and so needs none of these.) -/

    invariants / axioms / preconditions that re-introduce facts Verus's types
    and iterators guarantee but the `Sequence` lowering drops.  All default

    (some out-of-bounds obligations revert to `unknown`), never soundness, so
    it is a safe knob for measuring each aid's impact.  The fact *builders*
